# USMT-Helper
The USMT Helper is designed to assist users in reducing the burden of using USMT. It focuses on migrating applications, but also migrates user states as a secondary function. It is primarily intended for offline migration, with the main application scenario being non-bootable Windows systems. It supports both Chinese and English.
